# Create LinkedIn Post as Jasmin Alić

**Prompt:**
````text
Write a compelling LinkedIn post on [TOPIC] using Jasmin Alić’s content creation approach. Follow these instructions:

1. **Hook (First Sentence)** – Start with a strong, attention-grabbing promise or statement that clearly signals the main value the reader will get. Make it emotional, bold, and curiosity-driven. This should be 90% of the post’s power.
2. **Rehook (Second Sentence)** – Immediately strengthen the hook by addressing a likely objection, adding a surprising twist, or increasing the stakes. This should keep the reader committed to reading further.
3. **Body** – Use short paragraphs and simple, accessible language to expand on your idea. Organize your thoughts clearly and keep the pacing fast. Add relatable examples or analogies.
4. **Tone – “Dear Son” Approach** – Write as though you are addressing one specific person (a son, close friend, mentee, or client). Make it personal, warm, and conversational while still delivering clear value. Do not address the reader as "Son".
5. **Universal to Specific** – Begin with a broad, universally relatable idea before narrowing it to the specific niche related to [TOPIC].
6. **Clarity & Retention** – Avoid jargon, keep sentences concise, and ensure each line pulls the reader to the next.
7. **Closing** – End with a concise takeaway that delivers on the hook’s promise, optionally followed by a thought-provoking question to encourage comments and engagement.
