Vogue Editorial shot of a female model and retro 70s outfit

```text
A stylish retro woman in her 30s standing confidently, photorealistic, short voluminous auburn hair, porcelain skin, expressive blue eyes, wearing a full burnt orange outfit - fitted long-sleeve bodysuit with a deep V-neck, sheer ruffled mini skirt tied at the waist, matching orange leggings, and slouchy high-heeled boots. She has a matching orange neck scarf. The style is 1970s-inspired with a modern twist. Full body shot, studio white background, cinematic lighting, fashion magazine quality, confident pose with arms crossed, high-detail textures, Vogue editorial vibe.
