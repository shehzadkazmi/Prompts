Vogue male model in desert

```text
A hyper-detailed close-up portrait of a male model in a wind-swept desert environment, shot in 3:4 vertical format with extreme clarity and cinematic depth. The model's face dominates the frame, his skin textured with fine grains of white sand, catching the light in crystalline detail. He wears sleek, transparent amber-orange performance goggles with sculptural contours, the lenses slightly fogged and dusted with sand, framing deep, intent eyes. His short, tightly coiled hair is also lightly frosted with sand, adding a raw, elemental edge. The outfit blends high-fashion and utilitarian outdoor gear â€” a matte, rust-red technical jacket with visible moisture and dust marks, layered over a black neck gaiter. The backdrop is a minimalist gradient of pale desert beige fading into a cloudless cobalt sky, creating a stark, luxurious contrast. Shot with a 50mm prime lens at f/1.8 for a razor-thin depth of field, using natural midday sunlight for crisp, shadowless illumination, with subtle post-production color grading to enhance warm skin tones and deep sky blues. The image captures the tension between rugged endurance and luxury performance styling, evoking a modern expedition narrative.
