Studio Portrait in a formal suit (B&W)

```text
Create a cinematic black and white portrait of me adjusting my tie while wearing a classic, tailored suit. I stand confidently in a studio with strong side lighting similar like rembrandt light setup creating high contrast. Horizontal streaks of light (like light coming through curtains) create shadows on my face and suit. The expression is calm and confident, exuding elegance and determination. High fashion photography style, highly detailed, minimal and symmetrical composition. Ultra realistic. Ratio 9:16
